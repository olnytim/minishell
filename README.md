# Minishell Project Roadmap

This is a roadmap outlining the steps involved in creating a minishell project.

## Roadmap

1. **Project Setup and Basic Structure**
   - Set up the project directory and initialize necessary files.
   - Create the main program file, input parsing module, command execution module, and other modules as needed.
   - Decide on a consistent coding style and adhere to it throughout the project.

2. **Reading and Parsing User Input**
   - Read input from the user (commands and arguments).
   - Split the input into tokens (using whitespace as a delimiter).
   - Handle special characters like quotes, backslashes, and variable expansion if desired.

3. **Command Execution**
   - Implement basic command execution for built-in commands (e.g., `cd`, `exit`).
   - Fork a child process to execute external commands.
   - Set up proper communication between the parent and child processes.

4. **Input/Output Redirection**
   - Handle input redirection (`<`) by redirecting standard input to come from a file.
   - Handle output redirection (`>`) by redirecting standard output to a file or appending it to an existing file.

5. **Command Pipelines**
   - Implement command chaining using pipes (`|`) to redirect the output of one command as input to another.
   - Set up the necessary pipes and handle communication between multiple processes.

6. **Background Processes**
   - Allow commands to be executed in the background by using the `&` symbol.
   - Implement job control mechanisms to manage background processes.

7. **Signal Handling**
   - Handle signals such as `SIGINT` (Ctrl+C) to terminate foreground processes.
   - Implement signal handlers to gracefully handle signals and ensure proper cleanup.

8. **Environment Variables**
   - Support environment variables (e.g., accessing and modifying variables like `$PATH`).
   - Implement variable expansion and substitution.

9. **Command History**
   - Maintain a command history to allow users to navigate and recall previous commands.
   - Implement functionalities such as command history navigation (e.g., using arrow keys) and history expansion.

10. **Error Handling and Reporting**
    - Implement proper error handling for edge cases, invalid commands, and other potential issues.
    - Provide informative error messages to users.

11. **Testing and Debugging**
    - Write test cases to cover different scenarios, including edge cases.
    - Test your minishell with a variety of commands, input/output redirection, pipelines, and signal handling.
    - Use debugging techniques and tools to identify and fix any issues.

12. **Documentation and Code Review**
    - Document your code, including function descriptions, usage instructions, and any design choices.
    - Conduct code reviews to improve the quality and readability of your code.
